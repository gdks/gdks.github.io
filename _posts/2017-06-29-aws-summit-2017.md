## Keynote

Amazon CTO - Werner

#### Services Overview

Firewall not enough, protect components.

Security by design:
* AWS Inspector
* AWS Shield for DDOS
* Types of instance families

* Lambda & Step functions
* X-Ray
* DynamoDB
* DynamoDB Accelerator
* Database Migration Service
* Aurora MySQL and Postgres
* Big data - Redshift and EMR

DVLA and BP downstream case study

#### Deliveroo case study

Kinesis as events stream with Lambda processing.

Data Warehouse in s3 using Snowflake and Looker.

Elasticsearch for priority users.

#### AI as a Service

* Lex
* Polly
* Image Recognition

#### Ocado warehouse case study

Kinesis 100000 events per second

Anyone can do AI as service



## Security at Scale

Control at security group level - no box access.

Cloud more secure than on premise:
* can define security templates that can be iterated on
* easier to patch or patches managed
* define VPC and subnets at operations level



## Deep Dive on Microservices & ECS

#### Characteristics of Microservices

Decentralised, Polyglot, Independent, Do one thing well, black box, you build it - you run it.

#### ECS Benefits

* Worry more about app running & less about scaling.
* Stream events to CloudWatch.

User the console; it's quicker to get started.

## Steps

1. Create cluster - empty box
2. Create Task - describes service
3. Use Task to run service
4. Scale up or down using cli or based on CloudWatch alarms & Autoscaling



## Deep Dive: X-Ray

AWS X-Ray helps you debug and analyze your microservices applications with request tracing so you can find the root cause of issues and performance bottlenecks.

#### Use cases

* Understand your dependencies
* Visualise services as a map
* Dig down into map to view details
* Gives real time telemetry of how production systems are running

#### Costs

* First 100000 traces free
* First 1000000 trace retrievals free

#### Compatible services

ELB, Lambda, API Gateway, EC2, Elastic Beanstalk

Compatible with third party services at network level.

## Deep Dive: S3

Highly scalable object storage.

#### Types

S3 Standard - CDN, Big Data Analytics, Static Sites.

S3 Infrequent - Backups and Disaster Recovery.

Amazon Glacier - Archives and digital preservation. Replacement for tape.

#### Data Collection

* Snowball device
* Direct Connect
* Kinesis Firehose

#### Costs

* S3 Analytics
* Lifecycle policies

#### Other

Serve your frontend from S3.

Enable versioning and MFA on file deletions.

User tags instead of treating like a file system.

#### Dynamic Applications

* Amazon Athena - Store JSON in S3 and query as SQL using Presto SQL subset
* Redshift Spectrum -
* Index data using Elastic Search
* Trigger Lambdas on S3 events
* Can automatically trigger SNS and push things into SQS

Examples,
* Upload photo and do post processing
* Upload data and analyse

Use data as Event Triggers
