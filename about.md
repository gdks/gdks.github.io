## About

&nbsp;

I am a Software Engineer living and working in Edinburgh. I have around 10 years industry experience in both agency and product environments developing a variety of applications including e-commerce applications, CMS, email marketing systems, intranets and IT management systems.

I am passionate about both the products I build and the way in which I develop them. I aim to deliver innovative solutions that support the needs of today while considering future requirements.

I have experience working with both greenfield and legacy business critical systems, taking into account factors such as maintainability, separation of concerns and extensibility.

I enjoy being able to write clean code and have an understanding of the importance of good software design; TDD, continuous delivery and code review for every change that is introduced into the codebase are core principles that I follow.
